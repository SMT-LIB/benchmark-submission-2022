# The special soundness of PLONK's grand product argument

Let F be a prime-order field and n a natural less than F's size. Let n = {1,
2, .., n} be a subset of F. The PLONK[1] grand product argument relies on the
fact that given a permutation pi: [n] -> [n] and functions A, B: [n] -> [n],

    prod_i (A(i) + beta * i + gamma) = prod_i (B(i) + beta * pi(i) + gamma)

holds for random beta, gamma in F with good probability only when A composed
with pi is B.

Does this implication hold in a deterministic setting, where the above is
checked for distinct---but non-random---beta and gamma?

If it is checked for n+1 distinct values of beta, and for each value of beta,
n+1 distinct values of gamma, then yes. One can prove this.

If it is checked for 2 distinct values of beta, and for each value of beta, n+1
distinct values of gamma, then no.

This series of benchmarks checks the implication holds
* for varying n
* for a fixed permutation pi = (2 3 ... n 1)
* for all A and B
  * that must be equal ("same") or may differ ("diff")
* for all distinct 2 ("unsound") or n+1 ("sound") beta values

rather than instantiating gamma explicitly, we just check that the multisets

    {{A[i] + beta * i}}_i  ==  {{B[i] + beta * pi(i)}}_i

are equal.
